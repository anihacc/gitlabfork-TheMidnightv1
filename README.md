# The Midnight  
*The Midnight* is a mod being developed by Cryptic Mushroom that adds a new, mysterious and scary dimension to explore. It is a dimension of darkness; the only light comes from crystals and the various life of the dimension. You may travel willingly to this dimension, though you may unwillingly encounter a rifter and be dragged into this strange and hostile world...  
This is the official source code repository for The Midnight mod, originally made for SpookyJam 2018.

### How to get to The Midnight

#### For Users  
To get to the dimension, you will need to find a rift. These will spawn in red clumps of matter. Though before you go, make sure to be prepared! The Midnight is a hostile place.

#### For Developers  
We understand can be annoying to have to find a rift to access The Midnight every time. Here are a couple of commands to find/access the dimension with ease.  
Summon a Rift entity: `/locate midnight:entrance_rift`  
Teleport directly into The Midnight: `/forge setdimension @p midnight:midnight`
